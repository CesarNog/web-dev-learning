#### COMPUTING
- [Finite State Machines](http://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/223-finite-state-machines.html)
    - It consists of finite states. The new state depends on the old state and the input.
    - A finite state machine can represent any history and a reaction.
        -  Humans are finite state machines.  
        -  The Markov chain is a sort of probabilistic version of the finite state machine.
    - What is the point of such a simple machine?
        -  Many programming problems are most easily solved by actually implementing a finite state machine. 
        -  They allow us to explore the theory of computation
