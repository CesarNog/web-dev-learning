## Creating a Django project
###### Create the project folder, `tango_with_django_project`.
```
$ django-admin.py startproject tango_with_django_project
```
###### Run the project in your local server.
```
python manage.py runserver
```
## Creating a Django Application
###### Create the app folder for the `rango` app.
```
python manage.py startapp rango
```
###### Include the newly created app in the project's settings.
```
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'rango`,
)
```

## Creating a View
The `views.py` is where you can store a series of functions that take a clientsâ€™s requests and return responses.
```python
# rango/views.py

from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Rango says hey there world!")
```

## Mapping URLs
The contents of `urls.py` will allow you to map URLs for your application (e.g. http://www.tangowithdjango.com/rango/) to specific views.
```python
# rango/urls.py

from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
from rango import views

urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'))
```
